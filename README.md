# üß© Terminal Based Sudoku Generator and Solver
This is a simple terminal-based Sudoku solver and generator written in Python. It includes a basic menu system that allows users to generate new puzzles, solve existing ones, or play a game of Sudoku. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution to a given Sudoku puzzle.
